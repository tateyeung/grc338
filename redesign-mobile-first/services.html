            <p>Water Heater Installation and Repair is one of the core services that Hoffmann Family Plumbing provides.</p>
            <p>On average a standard water heater has a life expectancy of approximately 8-15 years. Of course this all depends on some variables such as how often it is used, upkeep, maintenance and brand. However, even with a life expectancy of over a decade many things can go wrong causing a water heater to need repair within this time frame. Please see our How your water heater works page for a helpful explanation on the inner workings of a gas fired water heater tank.</p>
            <p>Below is a checklist for a improperly functioning water heater, if you are experiencing even one of the above issues it is highly recommended that you consider calling a professional for a diagnosis. One of these repairs could prolong the life of your water heater by a significant time span, usually years, and save you hundreds of dollars in replacement costs!</p>

        <h3>Sewer Rooter and Drain Cleaning</h3>
            <p>Okay let's face it, drain clogs are disruptive, potentially catastrophic and often associated with foul, embarrassing odors.  We at Hoffmann Family Plumbing are used to it though. We understand that when dealing with sewer backups resulting from clogged drains, you need fast, reliable and professional service.  That's why San Luis Obispo calls on us to clean their drains right the first time.</p>
            <p>Although tree roots are the most common reason for a clogged sewer there are a number of other impediments that can back up your drains and wreak havoc on a pleasant and productive day. Sludge, hair, soap, grease, oil, dirt and food are all contributing causes of clogged drains, however there are other factors such as pipe deterioration due to age and even the shifting of the soil that can cause stoppages as well. This illustration below shows some of these examples in a main line stoppage. If you are having chronic sewer clogs the best way to get to the root of the problem is to have a sewer camera inspection to find out exactly what the problem is.</p>
            <p>Here are a few pointers to help prevent drain stoppage in your San Luis Obispo home or business:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your drains clear of dirt. Excessive dirt leads to sludge.</li>
                <li>Let the water run when using your disposal unit.  Food gathers around the drain and attaches to grease and oil creating clogs. San Luis Obispo restaurants: call Hoffmann Family Plumbing now to find out how we can help you prevent downtime and work outages!</li>
                <li>Drain and wipe all oil and grease from pans. Do not wash it down the drain or put oily dishes in the dishwasher.  Disposal and dishwasher clogs are too common and can be avoided. Save money and stress!</li>
                <li>Regularly clean your washing machine's drain, and if you can, install a dedicated drain. Let Hoffmann Family Plumbing tell you how. Call us today for drain cleaning and maintenance!</li>
